    <h2>J.S. Bach's Life</h2>
    <h5>By Shay Harris a2</h5>
    <h3>A fabulous organist... but can he do anything else?</h3>

    <p> Though not widely known as a composein his day, J.S. Bach was however one of the most popular organists.
    Bach was born the 21st of March 1685 and was
    the youngest of eight children. <br />
    <br />

    <h3>An orphan</h3>



In the year 1694 Bach's mother died, his father to follow only a little while later. Both had been musicians.
    Age ten, Sebastian went to live with his older, newlywed brother, Christoph. Christoph was the church organist at Ohrdruf and taught him the organ and harpsichord.
    <br />
    <br />
    He lived with his brother until he was 15.

He was accepted into a school in Luneburg through his unusual soprano voice. He lost his soprano voice though and
    switched to playing the harpsichord and violin at the school. <br />
    <br />

    <h3>The first real job and AWOL</h3>

    His first real job was as a musician at the court of Duke Johann Ernst. Later he received a job at a new church in Arnstadt as an organist. It was not well
    received when in 1705 he took a few weeks' leave... and then took a few more off without telling anyone.  <br />
    <br />


When he was 21 he married his cousin, Maria Barbara Bach.
    In the years to come the couple would have seven children, some of whom died as children.<br />
    <br />

    <h3>Another position and another unhappy boss</h3>



He got a position at the Church of St. Blaise in Mühlhausen, but his
    style wasn't well taken there where they believed that the music should be simple. <br />
    <br />
    After a year in Mühlhausen he received the position of organist in the court
    of Duke Wilhelm Ernst in Weimar. He wrote many famous pieces during his stay there. Bach was of the Lutheran faith and often wrote I.N.J. for 'In Nomine Jesu'
    (in English, 'in the name of Jesus'). <br />
    <br />

    <h3>Leaving isn't easy</h3>

    When he was age 32 he accepted a job offer with Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen... but Duke Wilhelm wasn't quite so keen on him leaving. The duke even put Bach
    in jail, but after several weeks let him go and Bach was allowed to go to Prince Leopold.<br />
    <br />


    <h3>Two weddings</h3>

    In 1720 his wife Maria died but he remarried a singer, Anna Magdalena Wülcken.  They had 13 children together but more than half died before adulthood.
    All of his children from both marriages were musical in one way or another. <br />
    <br />
    Prince Leopold was passionate about music, and Bach even wrote a series of orchestra pieces in his honor.  But in 1721 the prince married and his bride discouraged
    his musicality. By 1723 Bach had to find another place of work as Prince Leopold had disbanded his orchestra. <br />
    <br />

    <h3>The move to Leipzig</h3>

    He found a position as an organist and also a teacher at St. Thomas church which was in Leipzig.  He was required to compose new music every week for the service.
    This is where he wrote 'Passion According to St. Matthew.' <br />
    <br />

    <h3>Composing for the king</h3>
    Bach was starting to have great problems with his eyesight but he was still well enough to travel, including a journey
    to Prussia, where he made up a composition on the spot to entertain the King, Frederick the Great. <br />
    <br />

    <h3>The failed operation</h3>
    <p>When he was 65 he tried to fix his failing eyesight with surgery but the operation failed.  He had a stroke a little later and died June 28, 1750.
